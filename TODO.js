// TODO: Adjust the 'games' route to make a query to only get the columns of the game's info that I'm going to use.
// TODO: Add a 404 page.
// FIX: Figure out why the deletion of a publisher from the 'publishers' table deletes the game itself, probably is a 'on delete cascade' on the publishers table. Should be 'on delete set null';
//
// TODO: Fix genres icons in the index page.
// TODO: Add class names to the sidebar in the 'games' page and make them the same for the 'addGameForm' page.
//
// FIX: Modify the sidebar in the 'index.ejs' page to display correctly the hidden links by adding and element that will contain the links.
